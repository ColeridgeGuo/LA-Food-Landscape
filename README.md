## Data
- Run `csv_to_json.ipynb` locally to convert `real_data.csv` to `real_data.json`.
- The file `list of descriptions.txt` has the list of unique `PE_DESCRIPTIONS` to be added to html.
  - can be added dynamically using JavaScript the same way as `healthCat` is.
- Make sure `LA Food Landscape.html`, `LA County Zip Codes.geojson`, `real_data.json`, `jquery-3.3.1.js`, `Furman_logo.jpg`, `UCLA_logo.png`, `about.pdf`, `csv_to_json.ipynb`, and `real_data.csv` are all uploaded to the server within the same folder.
